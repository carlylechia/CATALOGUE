# CATALOGUE OF THINGS

In this project, we will create a console app that will help to keep a record of different types of things won: books, music albums, and movies. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.

## UML Class Diagram
